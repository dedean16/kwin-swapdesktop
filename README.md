# Virtual Desktop Shortcuts - Swap/Add/Remove
Adds keyboard shortcuts to KWin that swap the windows of the current virtual desktop with those of the next/previous/upper/lower desktop, or add/remove a desktop at the current position. When swapping to the 0th/last+1 desktop, a new desktop will be added to make the swap possible. When removing a desktop, its windows will be moved to the next desktop.

Default shortcuts are: Meta+Shift+Alt+Right/Left/Up/Down/=/-. These can be changed in System Settings → Global Shortcuts → KWin → (search for DESKTOPS)
